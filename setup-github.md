# GitHub Repository Setup for Cosmic Chronicle

## Steps to Create GitHub Repository:

### 1. Create New Repository on GitHub

- Go to: https://github.com/new
- Repository name: `cosmic-chronicle`
- Description: `🌌 Interactive space exploration website with astronomical events and constellation game`
- Make it **Public**
- **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands in terminal:

```bash
# Set repository name in package.json
npm pkg set name="cosmic-chronicle"

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cosmic-chronicle.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

- Go to: https://vercel.com/new
- Import your new GitHub repository: `cosmic-chronicle`
- Vercel will auto-detect it's a Vite project
- Deploy settings:
  - Build Command: `npm run build`
  - Output Directory: `dist`

### 4. Your Live Website
